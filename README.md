# Data Security using Image Steganography

## Project Description
This project implements a data security system using image steganography in Python. The main goal is to hide sensitive data within images in such a way that it is undetectable to the naked eye.

## Features
- **Image Steganography**: Embeds data within an image by manipulating the least significant bits of the pixel values in the image.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts the data using a secure encryption algorithm before embedding to add an extra layer of security.

## Installation
Install all the necessary packages.
